# Robo-Chase
This was the protoype for a project I did for fundamental of programming on Stencyl in first semester. It was mostly me messing around with stencyl to get a feel what it is and how to operate it. I may have a bit of sentimental attachment to it since it was the first project of sorts I made so here it is. I'd like to thanks all the youtube tutorials out there who help noobs like me to get a hang of things. 

Now to give a bit of a preamble of what the game consists of: 
It is basically an action game of sorts where the player( a mini robot) is being chased by an enemy robot(hence the name Robo chase) while they are collecting "cards"(the currency for this game). The player has to avoid the enemy robot and collect all cards in order to win this game else it's game over.

The structure of the game itself is relatively simple as it consists of four scenes; Start Screen(displays the name of the game and prompts the user to start), Level 1(functions as the main.cpp file for this game),Lose Screen and Win Screens (who's purposes are really self explanatoy). You will need to have the Stencyl App to run this game. That's about it I think. If you need any help running this file feel free to contact me.Ciao.
